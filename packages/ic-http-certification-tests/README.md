# HTTP Certification Tests

This crate holds integration tests for the [`ic-http-certification`](../ic-http-certification/README.md) and [`ic-response-verification`](../ic-response-verification/README.md) crates. Each crate has its own unit tests to validate functionality in isolation, while these integration tests serve the purpose of allowing these crates to mutually verify one another when used in combination.
